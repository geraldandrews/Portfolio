               <p>
                 This project is a banner I created of the 2022 NCAA football National Championship using the photo
                 manipulation software called GIMP. I added in the colors of each team to each side of the main
                 background layer and then added another background layer on top and added in the Filters/Render/Noise
                 Difference Clouds effect and set the layer to multiply mode to complete the background. I then added in
                 PNG images I created of players for each team, a PNG image I created of Alabama and Georgia with the 
                 Crimson and Bulldog red backgrounds with a white border and added the PNG trophy image on top of that 
                 and added a drop shadow effect to it. I added the black National Championship text and changed the 
                 color and added some layers and set the opacity down to give it kind of a glossy look. I then added the
                 PNG Southeastern United States image I created and used the Emboss tool in the Filters tab and the
                 Brushed Aluminum Blend Tool to give it kind of a greyish metallic look. Finally, I added the SEC png
                 image on top to complete the project.

                 This project is a banner I created of the television series Cobra Kai using the photo manipulation
                 software GIMP. First I removed backgrounds from all of the characters and logos shown on the banner 
                 and converted them to PNG images. Next I created an orange background layer and added a layer of a 
                 sunset I created with several layers with linear gradients and the blur filter and the circle elipse 
                 tool. Added the PNG images of the logos, text, palm trees, and characters I created as layers to 
                 finish project.

                 This project is an NBA basketball banner I created of two of my favorite NBA players growing up using
                 the photo manipulation software called GIMP. The tools I used were the Render/Noise/Difference 
                 Clouds method in the filters tab to create the background. I used the text tool with the varsity font to create the 
                 text, added PNG image layers of the players to the banner and used the overlay effect for the player images blended in
                 the background. I added the logos for each player of the banner by adding text, the Jordan logo PNG image, and 
                 a jersey fabrication layer as the background layer and set that to overlay. I added another layer to the logos to
                 create the white border around the logos.

               <p>
                 This project is a Christmas card cover I created using the photo manipulation software program GIMP.
                 First I set a blue background with the rendering clouds effect and added a white layer to the bottom
                 of the background. I then set a gaussian blur to the top of the white layer to give it the snowy ground look. 
                 I added in the falling snow using the noise and blur filters and adjusted the levels accordingly. I added the star using
                 the star brush tool and adjusted the aspect ratios to give it the bright look. After that I added
                 a layer of an actual winter photo of mountains I took and moved it below the blue and white background
                 layer. I then used the foreground to transparency bi-linear blend tool to over part of the blue and white
                 background layer to reveal the mountains in the background image. I added a layer of icy text I created
                 with GIMP using various filters with snow on top I created using the free select and air brush tools.
                 I added layers of the PNG images of the houses, Santa Clause, the reef, christmas tree, and icicles in 
                 each corner. I added several border layers to the card using different colors, the rendering clouds filter, 
                 and PNG snowflake images.

                 This project is a banner card cover of the area I live in, the two Bluefields which are divided by the
                 West Virginia and Virginia state line. First I added a layer of an actual photo I took from the overlook
                 and then added two layers of each town over the bottom of the overlook photo. Over the towns image layers,
                 I added a blue layer with a radial gradient and then decreased the opacity to give a dark overlay effect.
                 I then added the text with a white border, town logos, and PNG images with a red border I created from added 
                 layers. I then added PNG images of the American flag and the states of West Virginia and Virginia to
                 the top of the overlook image. I added the maroon background to the states and used the canvas filter
                 to give it a canvas looking effect and the white star to illustrate the location of the two towns. Finally
                 I added the border layers of different colors to the banner.

                 This project is an Independence Day Banner I created using the photo manipulation software program
                 GIMP. I added the first layer which includes a rotated image of the constitution to create the 
                 background. I added a layer with PNG images of fireworks and set the mode to multiply to get the 
                 blend in effect with the constitution layer. I added a layer with a PNG image of the United States
                 and added another layer over it of the American flag to give the background. I added a layer of a png
                 image of our forefathers and set the mode to overlay for the blend in effect with the flag. I added
                 PNG images of the Statue of Liberty, soldiers, and an eagle for the final touches.

                 the players, team logos, palm trees, and trophy from images I found online and placed them on the banner 
                 along with the background image. In the center of the banner, I merged the football logo, 2023
                 logo, and trophy logo together and then placed a thick white stroke around the merged layer. Finally I
                 placed layers of the teams colors over their side of the banner erased the top parts of the layer over the
                 city and set the mode to multiply.
